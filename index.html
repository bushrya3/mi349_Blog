            <h2>Why You Should Buy Super Mario Party Jamboree</h2>
            <h5>October 13, 2024</h5>
            <h5>By Ryan Bush</h5>
            <p>With the release of Nintendo's Super Mario Party Jamboree on the horizon, you may be wondering if it will be worth purchasing. Based on everything I know about the game, I have decided to compile a handful reasons I believe you should buy the game when it launches on October 17th.</p>

            <h3>1. Biggest Mario Party Yet</h3>
            <p>As stated in Nintendo's marketing for the game, Super Mario Party Jamboree will be the biggest game in the series. Featuring 22 playable characters, 7 boards, 112 minigames, and 7 modes, this game is sure to have something for everyone. </p>
            <h3>2. Online Multiplayer</h3>
            <p>For the second time in the series, Super Mario Party Jamboree will launch with full online functionality for its main board game mode. Players can compete with their friends or match against random opponents. Additionally, two new modes will make use of online play. The 20-player Koopathlon mode pits players against each other in a race to collect the most coins. Bowser Kaboom Squad is a cooperative mode that challenges 8 players to work together to defeat a giant Impostor Bowser.</p>
            <h3>3. Return to Classic Board Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Super Mario Party Jamboree returns to the series roots, being the first completely new game to feature a dice block that rolls up to 10 since Mario Party DS in 2007. 2018's Super Mario Party made an attempt at being a return to form, but ultimately failed in the eyes of fans due to its small board size, lack of boards, unbalanced new mechanics, and painfully slow pacing. Mario Party Superstars fixed all of these issues when it released in 2021, but it only featured remade content from older games. Jamboree takes the solid foundation laid by Superstars and expands upon it with brand new content. The new boards are all large and feature unique mechanics to keep gameplay interesting. The board mechanics and new items create an element of strategy that has been missing from the series for almost two decades. </p>
            <h3>4. Returning Content</h3>
            <p>In addition to the all the new content, Super Mario Party Jamboree is bringing back 10 minigames from previous entries. The Mario's Rainbow Castle board from Mario Party 1 will return alongside Western Land from Mario Party 2.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Whether or not you intend to buy the game on day one, I hope that this list will convince you to try it at some point. It may be too early to say, but I believe this game has the potential to be the best in the series.</p>
